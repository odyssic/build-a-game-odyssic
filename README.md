## Directions to Play

The enemies will begin shooting projectiles from above, while moving from side to side. 

Navigate away from them by using the left and right arrow. Use the spacebar to fire. Hold down the space bar to let out a stream of projectiles. If you get hit, you lose. If you destroy all of the enemies, you win! 

This is based on Mary Rose Cook's space invaders game that she coded live at a demo.
